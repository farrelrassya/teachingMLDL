# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks primarily designed for analyzing visual imagery. They leverage convolutional operations and hierarchical patterns to automatically learn important features from data, making them a cornerstone in the field of computer vision. Over time, CNN architectures have evolved from relatively simple, pioneering designs to sophisticated state-of-the-art (SOTA) models that push the boundaries of performance in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

## Overview

**CNNs** introduce the concept of parameter sharing and local connectivity through convolutional layers. These properties allow the network to extract spatial hierarchies of features, beginning with edges and simple shapes in the early layers and gradually building up to complex, object-level representations in deeper layers.

### Key Concepts

- **Convolutional Layers**: Learnable filters slide across input images, detecting local patterns.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions while retaining key features, aiding in computational efficiency and providing translation invariance.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Serve as classifiers at the end of the network, mapping extracted features to output predictions.
- **Non-Linear Activations**: Functions like ReLU introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex relationships.
