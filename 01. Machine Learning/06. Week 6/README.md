# üöÄ Week 06: Clustering Methods - k-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN

## üéØ Clustering Algorithms Overview

Clustering is an **unsupervised learning** technique used to group similar data points together based on their inherent characteristics. It helps in discovering underlying patterns or structures within datasets without the need for predefined labels.

## ‚öôÔ∏è k-Means Clustering

**k-Means Clustering** partitions data into 'k' distinct, non-overlapping clusters. It works by minimizing the sum of squared distances (inertia) between data points and their corresponding cluster centroids.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement.
- **Scalability**: Efficient for large datasets.
- **Centroid-Based**: Clusters are defined by the centroids of the data points.
- **Parameter Requirement**: The number of clusters 'k' must be specified beforehand.
- **Sensitivity**:
  - Results depend on the initial placement of centroids.
  - Sensitive to outliers and noisy data.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized.

### üìà Applications

- Customer segmentation.
- Image compression.
- Market segmentation.

## üå≤ Hierarchical Clustering

**Hierarchical Clustering** creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to represent data clusters. It can be **Agglomerative** (bottom-up) or **Divisive** (top-down).

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **No Need to Specify 'k'**: The number of clusters can be chosen by cutting the dendrogram at the desired level.
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Provides a multilevel hierarchy of clusters.
- **Distance Metrics**:
  - Various metrics like Euclidean, Manhattan, or Cosine can be used.
- **Linkage Criteria**:
  - **Single Linkage**: Minimum distance between points.
  - **Complete Linkage**: Maximum distance between points.
  - **Average Linkage**: Average distance between all pairs of points.
  - **Ward's Method**: Minimizes the total within-cluster variance.
- **Interpretability**: Dendrograms offer visual insights into data clustering at different levels.

### üìà Applications

- Gene expression data analysis.
- Document clustering.
- Social network analysis.

## üõ∞Ô∏è DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

**DBSCAN** clusters data based on the density of data points in a region, allowing it to find clusters of arbitrary shape and identify outliers.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Density-Based**: Forms clusters based on areas of high density separated by areas of low density.
- **No Need to Specify 'k'**: Automatically determines the number of clusters based on data.
- **Outlier Detection**: Effectively identifies and handles noise points (outliers).
- **Cluster Shape Flexibility**: Can detect clusters of arbitrary shape.
- **Parameters**:
  - **`eps`**: The maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered neighbors.
  - **`min_samples`**: The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered a core point.

### üìà Applications

- Spatial data analysis.
- Anomaly detection.
- Clustering of non-globular clusters.

## üìù Best Practices

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - **Standardization**: Normalize or standardize data when using distance-based algorithms.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA or t-SNE for high-dimensional data to improve clustering performance.
- **Parameter Selection**:
  - **k-Means**:
    - Use the **Elbow Method** or **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters 'k'.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**:
    - Choose an appropriate linkage criterion and distance metric.
  - **DBSCAN**:
    - Experiment with `eps` and `min_samples` using methods like the **k-distance graph**.
- **Algorithm Selection**:
  - **k-Means**: Best for well-separated, spherical clusters and large datasets.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Useful when the cluster hierarchy is important or when the dataset is small.
  - **DBSCAN**: Ideal for datasets with clusters of varying shapes and sizes, and for detecting outliers.
- **Validation**:
  - Use internal validation metrics like **Silhouette Score**, **Davies-Bouldin Index**, or **Calinski-Harabasz Index**.
  - Compare results from different algorithms to ensure robustness.
