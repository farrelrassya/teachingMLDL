# ðŸŒ³ Week 03: Instance-Based Methods and Tree-Based Methods

## ðŸŒ² Decision Tree Regression and Classification

**Decision Trees** are supervised learning algorithms used for both regression and classification tasks. They work by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like model of decisions.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal**: To predict the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data's features.

### âœ¨ Key Features

- **Intuitive Visualization**: Provides a clear visual representation of the decision-making process.
- **Versatile**: Suitable for both regression and classification tasks.
- **Handles Various Data Types**: Can manage both numerical and categorical data.
- **Minimal Data Preparation**: Requires little to no data preprocessing.

## ðŸ¤– k-NN Regression and Classification

**k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** is an instance-based learning algorithm applicable to both regression and classification tasks. It predicts outcomes based on the 'k' most similar instances (neighbors) from the training data.

- **Classification**: Predicted class is determined by a majority vote among neighbors.
- **Regression**: Predicted value is the average of the neighbors' values.

### ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Simple & Effective**: No explicit training phase; straightforward to implement.
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Performance depends heavily on the choice of 'k' and the distance metric used.
- **Non-Parametric**: Makes no underlying assumptions about the data distribution.
- **Adaptable**: Capable of modeling complex, non-linear relationships.

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Both **Decision Trees** and **k-NN** are powerful tools in your machine learning toolkit, each with its own strengths and considerations. Decision Trees offer high interpretability and handle various data types well, while k-NN is prized for its simplicity and effectiveness in modeling non-linear relationships.
