# Bi-RNN with Bayesian Optimization

This repository contains an end-to-end notebook that builds and trains a Bidirectional RNN (Bi-RNN) for text classification using TensorFlow. The notebook also demonstrates how to optimize hyperparameters with Bayesian Optimization using Keras Tuner.

## Overview

In this project, we implement a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN) to perform text classification on a news dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and leverages hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization to automatically search for the best model configuration. The notebook covers the complete pipeline:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, tokenization, and padding of text data.
- **Model Architecture:** An embedding layer followed by a bidirectional LSTM, dense layers, dropout, and an output layer for classification.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Bayesian Optimization is used to optimize various hyperparameters such as embedding dimension, LSTM units, dense layer units, dropout rate, learning rate, and regularization parameters.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Model retraining on the full dataset with callbacks (early stopping and model checkpoint) and evaluation on a test set.
- **Visualization:** Learning curves and confusion matrix plots for performance analysis.

## Project Highlights
- Bidirectional RNN (Bi-RNN): The model reads the text in both forward and backward directions, enabling a better understanding of context.
- Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization: Automated search over multiple hyperparameters to achieve improved model performance without manual trial-and-error.
- Visualization and Evaluation: Detailed analysis using learning curves and confusion matrices to diagnose the model's behavior.
  
## Future Improvements
- Advanced Regularization: Further explore L2 regularization, batch normalization, and additional dense layers.
- Transfer Learning: Incorporate pre-trained embeddings or transformer-based models for potentially higher performance.
- Explainable AI (xAI): Integrate xAI tools (such as LIME or SHAP) for deeper insights into model predictions.
